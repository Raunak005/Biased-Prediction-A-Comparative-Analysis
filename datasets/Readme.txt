Whenever I upload 'train.csv' (the training data set) which is around 65.6 MB to the GitHub repository, I am getting the error "Yowza, that’s a big file. Try again with a file smaller than 25MB."

Hence, please use the below link to download both the training ('train.csv') and test ('test.csv') data sets.

Please place both these downloaded csv files in this folder. Overwrite wherever necessary.

Thank you.
